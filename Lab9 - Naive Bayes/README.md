## Naive Bayesian Classifier
The Naive Bayes classifier applies the Bayes rule and an independence assumption to calculate the posterior probability of each class. The class with the highest probability is chosen as the output.  
For this algorithm, we classify the mnist digit data (10 different classes).  
Results are in the notebook.
